# Bug Report: Child Recipe Artifact Refs Duplicate Submitted Artifacts

Detected: 2026-05-19
Status: Confirmed fixed on 2026-05-19

## Summary

When a parent recipe passes a submitted artifact to a child recipe through
`recipe.run_and_get_result.inputs.artifacts`, the child job can fail before
execution with a duplicate submitted artifact error.

The parent passes artifact refs like:

```yaml
artifacts: '${{ context.artifacts.map(k, context.artifacts[k]) }}'
```

The child binds those artifacts with:

```yaml
artifacts:
  submitted/: '${{ context.artifacts }}'
```

Expected behavior: the child job receives one submitted artifact ref named
`brief.md`, and the child op can materialize it at
`{{ context.environment.op.inbox }}/submitted/brief.md`.

Actual behavior: child job startup reports two submitted artifacts with the
same name:

```text
duplicate submitted artifact name "brief.md" refers to both
stored:<parent-job>:0:brief.md and stored:<child-job>:0:brief.md
```

## Impact

Before the fix, recipes could not verify or rely on parent-to-child artifact
forwarding for submitted artifacts. This blocked `new-ticket` from safely
forwarding submitted files to child planning recipes and having those children
bind the files through `context.artifacts`.

Current `/src/recipe-tests` scenario coverage does not catch this because the
`new-ticket` child recipe calls are mocked as `recipe.run_and_get_result`
outputs. Those mocks validate orchestration decisions, but they do not inspect
the rendered child start request and do not execute the child job with its
received artifacts.

The live coverage added in `/src/recipe-tests/verify-child-artifact-forwarding-live.sh`
does exercise the real parent/child path: it submits `brief.md` once to a parent
recipe, forwards `context.artifacts` to a child recipe, and has the child bind
`submitted/: '${{ context.artifacts }}'` and read
`submitted/brief.md` from its op inbox.

## Minimal Reproduction

Create a repo with two cell recipes:

```yaml
# .c2j/recipes/parent-artifact-forwarding.yaml
id: parent-artifact-forwarding
version: "1.0"
sequence:
  - id: child
    op: recipe.run_and_get_result
    inputs:
      name: child-artifact-forwarding
      inputs: {}
      artifacts: '${{ context.artifacts.map(k, context.artifacts[k]) }}'
outputs:
  child_received: "${{ sequence.child.outputs.outputs.received }}"
```

```yaml
# .c2j/recipes/child-artifact-forwarding.yaml
id: child-artifact-forwarding
version: "1.0"
sequence:
  - id: verify
    op: command_execution
    artifacts:
      submitted/: '${{ context.artifacts }}'
    inputs:
      timeout: 10s
      run: |
        set -euo pipefail
        test -f "{{ context.environment.op.inbox }}/submitted/brief.md"
        grep -q "child-artifact-forwarding-ok" "{{ context.environment.op.inbox }}/submitted/brief.md"
outputs:
  received: true
```

Run:

```bash
printf 'child-artifact-forwarding-ok\n' > /tmp/brief.md
c2j submit --cell "$REPO" \
  --recipe parent-artifact-forwarding \
  --artifact /tmp/brief.md \
  --embed \
  --tenant-id recipe-tests \
  --json
```

Execute the parent until it reports `wait_for=<child-job-id>`, execute the child
job, then continue the parent. The child fails while indexing submitted
artifacts.

## Likely Cause

`recipe.run_and_get_result` appears to start the child with both:

- concrete SWF `Artifacts` resolved from the refs
- `ArtifactRefs` containing the same refs

The child job's submitted artifact indexing then sees the same logical artifact
name from both sources and treats it as a conflict.

## Requirements

- Passing stored artifact refs to `recipe.run_and_get_result` or `recipes.run*`
  must not create duplicate submitted artifact names in the child job.
- A child job should expose each passed artifact once in `context.artifacts`.
- A child recipe must be able to bind the received artifact set with
  `submitted/: '${{ context.artifacts }}'`.
- Duplicate detection should still reject true conflicts where two distinct
  user-provided artifacts with the same child-visible name are passed.
- Add an integration test where a parent receives a submitted artifact, forwards
  it to a child recipe, and the child command op reads it from its inbox.

## Verification

Confirmed with:

```bash
C2J_BIN=/tmp/c2j-latest recipe-tests/verify-child-artifact-forwarding-live.sh
```

The child completed its `command_execution` op after reading
`{{ context.environment.op.inbox }}/submitted/brief.md`, and no duplicate
submitted artifact error was reported.
