## Notes for Test Authoring

- Prefer `recipe_case` with explicit op mocks for deterministic branch coverage under test-policy sandboxing.
- Op mocks are single-use per invocation; if a node/op can run multiple times, add one mock entry per expected invocation.
- For selector-backed c2ops at `@main`, mock `recipe_within_resolution` once per case and mock the c2j diagnostic node path or op `extension_execution`.
- Recipes that need cell catalogs should load them through `c2j cells --json`; tests should mock the `load_cells` node rather than pass cell lists as public inputs.
- Use `integration_case` only when external workflow context is required and available in the harness.
- Keep artifact assertions focused on outbox contract files, not assistant summary text.
- For live skill checks, use workflow-run acceptance tests that validate authoring quality and contrarian rejection behavior, not just recipe node wiring.
